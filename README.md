#10kssembly
10kssembly is a POC and benchmark program that experiements with a number of NASM system calls for dealing
with multiple TCP connections. 10kssembly is meant to demonstrate the 10k problem using multi-processing,
select and epoll system calls. The client then benchmarks these systems for their performance. All components
are coded in Linux NASM x64 Assembly, giving a performance boost in these different systems
