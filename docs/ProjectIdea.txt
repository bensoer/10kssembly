The project will be a NASM x64 Assembly project that explores a number of system calls previously studied in C/C++.

Specificaly this project is a recreation of the 10k problem which is a benchmarking of the efficiency of a server program when dealing with 10 thousand clients. The idea of the project is to recreate this in NASM x64 assembly

Additionaly, this will be an opportunity to study the efficiency of the 10k problem when implemented in Assembly versus C/C++



The project will incorporate the implementation of a multi-process server, a server using epoll, and a server using select. Then a client that will interact with these servers. All 4 of these components will be written in NASM x64 Assembly
